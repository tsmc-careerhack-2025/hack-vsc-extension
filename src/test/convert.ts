    "Python uses sets to efficiently store unique elements, similar to Java's HashSet. The 'not in' operator checks for set membership.  f-strings (formatted string literals) provide a concise way to include variables in output strings like Java's System.out.println, but with more flexibility and readability.",
    "The order of elements when iterating through a set in Python is not guaranteed to be the same as the insertion order or any specific order. If preserving the original order of unique elements is crucial, consider using a dictionary or an OrderedDict (from the collections module) instead of a set.",
    "Python's list comprehension can be used for more concise creation of collections, but for this specific task, the explicit loop and set operations are more readable and directly map to the Java code's logic.  If performance is critical for very large datasets, consider profiling both approaches.",
    "Python's dynamic typing simplifies variable declarations compared to Java.  No explicit type annotations are required for integers or sets in this example.  Type hinting can be added for improved code clarity and maintainability in larger projects using tools like MyPy."

  "potential_compatibility_issues": [
    "The primary difference to note is that Java's HashSet maintains insertion order (as of Java 8), while Python's set does not guarantee any specific order.  If the order of unique numbers is important for your application's logic, you'll need to use a different data structure in Python, such as a dictionary or an OrderedDict (from the collections module).",
    "Error handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values in the input list) is not explicitly included in the provided Java code.  If such error handling is required, it should be added to both the Java and Python versions for robust operation."
